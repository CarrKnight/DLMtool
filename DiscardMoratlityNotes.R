# NOTES 

# default allocation? - set to 0?
# allocation vector - needs to be converted to matrix for nareas > 2
# needs to be generalized for nareas > 1 
# Emult <- 1 + ((2/apply(fishdist * Si, 1, sum)) - 1) *   Ai  # allocate effort to new area according to fraction allocation Ai

# default spatial closure - none. Need to change if historical spatial closure is included

# make sure retention curve is updated for every year in the future - even when MP isn't applied

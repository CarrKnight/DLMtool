# OMx 


## Biological Reference Points

SB0 and B0 are calculated dynamically - every year given that years life-history parameters

Recruitment parameters are calculated from the unfished spawning-stock-per-recruit averaged over the first 10 years

Unfished biological reference points used to calculate depletion are calculated from average 10 years around last historical year - 
i.e mean(N0[(nyears-5):(nyears+4)]). Unless proyears < 4

SSB0 used for *both* initial and current depletion is calculated from average SB0 from today's conditions

MSY reference points are calculated from the same reference years - 10 years around current year 
Selectivity is averaged over recent 10 years

MSY is calculated assuming that all fish that suffer fishing mortality are retained by the fishery - ie if there is a large degree of discarding, actual catches will be < MSY 
even if F is exactly FMSY

Reference yield - calculate by projecting population forward from its current state (last historical year) and optimizing for highest yield from a fixed F policy
